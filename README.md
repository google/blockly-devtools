## Setting Up

### Install node and NW.js

In order to properly run and test Blockly's devtools, install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your computer, as well as [NW.js](https://nwjs.io/downloads/). Instructions for installation can be found on the linked sites.

### Running Devtools

After cloning this repository, find the relative path to `nwjs/nw` that you installed onto your computer. Run the following command from the repo's directory.

```
nwjs/nw .
```

Doing so will run devtools as an NW.js application on your computer.
